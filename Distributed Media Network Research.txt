Seems to be a recent project that is attempting to do what we're considering. At the moment it does not work,
but it still appears to be in development.

It does not appear that this project concept the way I imagine it has been implemented in any major project. There's so little information on
it that it would be tough to give an estimate on the difficulty, although I believe it would still be doable.
